list1.sort() # Devika will google how to sort in descending



list1.append(37)

print("This is the list before poping a member.")
print(list1)

print("I will pop a member from the list.")
print(list1.pop(0))

print("This is the list after poping is over.")
print(list1)


firstNumber = 4
powerNumber = 3

answerNumber = firstNumber ** powerNumber

print("The poer number result is : ")
print(answerNumber)


string1 = "Devika"

print(string1[2:6])

print("Hello, %s !" % string1)

print("Hello, %s! You are %d years old today." % (string1, 23))

print("The list of class score is is %s " % [21, 23, 25, 26])
