## Concepts
  - variables
  - print - prebuilt function
  - Arithmatic operations
  - CamelCase
  - Varibale names cannot have spaces
  - assign values to bucket
  - Execution haapens in sequence from top to bottom

```py
bucketOne = 20
bucketOne = "Bananna"
bucketOne = 60

#Arithmatic + - * / %(modulus)

number1 = 20
number2 = 3

bucketTwo = number1 + number2

bucket_Three = number1 * number2

print(bucket_Three)
#print(bucketTwo)
#print(bucketOne)
```
